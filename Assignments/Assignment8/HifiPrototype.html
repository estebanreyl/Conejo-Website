									<h3>Conejo Android App</h3>
										<img src="../../images/android.png" style="width:40%; padding-left:10%"/>
										<p>For the Hi-Fi prototype we completed an android app following best android material design practices. The app can be installed to mobile phones using the below link.
										Furthermore we have provided the source code for the app for any further inquiry in the github repository available below.</p>
										<p>*Note that you must first follow the instructions for installing
											 android apps from unknown sources to install an apk file into an android phone. These instructions can be found in the
										   following link:</p>

								<h3>Prototype Information</h3>
									<h4>General Use Notes</h4>
									<ul>
									<li>The app begins at a login screen where you are asked for an email and a password.
									The email can be any valid email address (at least in format) and the password any
									alphanumeric combination of 5-14 characters. Note that the login screen is provided
									to give a sense of the app but has no further functionality and thus no register screens exists. <br>
									<li>Some screens contain help messages on their first open on a given session, you can tap anywhere outside
									of these to remove them.
									<li> All items are clickable and perform actions save for some on the profile page which do display a message
									 when an item is tried to be clicked but was not been implemented for this demo
									</ul>
									<h4>Screen by Screen Notes</h4>
									<ul>
									<li><strong>Main Screen</strong><br>
									This screen allows multiple actions, among them:<br>
									o Edit each owned item, tap on the edit button for this. Small x items will pop up on the cards with
									 wardrobe items, tapping on these will remove them. Note that the removal is temporary only for the
									 duration of the app as this info is not actually stored for future runs. New launches will always load the
									 same full wardrobe.<br>
									o Open the add new item screen. Click on edit and then on the appearing + button to open it. <br>
									o Swipe cards across the carousels to go through wardrobe Items. <br>
									o Tap on a an item to lock it in place, all unlocked item type carousels will automatically update showing only
									 items that match with the locked items (randomnly selected right now). <br>
									o Long press an item to go to its explore page. <br>
									o Tap on the profile icon on top of the page to access profile information. <br>
									<li><strong>Explore Screen</strong><br>
									This screen allows multiple actions and randomnly generates item names and descriptions. It includes the following central actions:<br>
									o Viewing similar items (currently use all items from the respective item lists as in no new items are shown
									 as this would constitute the need for a significantly large database). Further note items show randomnly generated
									 prices which in practice should be queried from a database <br>
									o By clicking on any given item on can open their buy screen <br>
									<li><strong>Buy Screen</strong><br>
									This screen allows a user to view a randomly generated description and a carried over price for each item and permits the purchasing
									 of an item. Know that purchasing an item, while giving confirmation dialogs does not in fact have any attached functionality as this would
									 involve actually selling items.
									<li><strong>Profile Screen and sub Screens</strong><br>
									Everything in the profile section of the app is hardcoded and non random as the user does not actually introduce profile information any time before.
									Not all screens/features under profiles are shown as they were not deemed necessary for displaying the project itself, these can be seen below:<br>
									o Payment screen - Implemented (Hardcoded)
									o Orders screen - Not implemented (not important for the general hi-fi user experience)
									o Shipping info screen - Not implemented (not important for the general hi-fi user experience)
									o Change password - Not implemented (as there is no registering to the app this is unecessary)
									o Logout - Implemented
									<li><strong>Add screen</strong><br>
									This screen allows for the taking of pictures to register items which an AI would theoreticaly identify. Right now it shows a camera preview and help dialogs
									as well as showing an on picture taken message. Wizard of Oz is definitely emplyed in this screen.
								</ul>
									<h4>Prototype Notes</h4>
									<ul>
									<li>The prototype is extremely functional and essentially any logical action a user can take is implemented or displays a not implemented message<br>
									<li>A lot of the wizard of OZ techniques used fake the implementation of AI using randomly generated data from hardcoded data sets<br>
								</ul>
