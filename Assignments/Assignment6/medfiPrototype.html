								<h3>Prototype Information</h3>
									<h4>General Use Notes</h4>
									<ul>
									<li>The shop is searchable, you can do this by clicking on the top bar which immediately takes you
									to a hardcoded search which can be accessed to look at the product page of the sought item.<br>
									o To leave search tap on the x button in the search bar)
									<li>Taping the lower right wardrobe button takes you to your registered items location.
									<li>The main screen recommendations are not currently tap-able as they simply would show a buy
									screen and this functionality is demonstrated through the wardrobe.
									<li>Only the shoe items on the wardrobe can be accessed.
									<li>Within this menu, a user can either click on their pre-owned items or register a new one by
									pressing the top right add sign.
									<li>The top right add sign takes you to a screen where you can in theory scan an item simply by
									taking a picture of it, this however is something we cannot do now but have claimed to have
									done for the two previously registered shoes. (Wizard of Oz)<br>
									<li>One of the shoe items in the wardrobe can be clicked taking a user to a mock up representation
									of how the recommendations for an outfit given an item would look.<br>
									o Each item (save for the selected item, in this case the shoes) are shown as swappable
									for other items that complete the recommended style as indicated by the arrows,
									however, the prototype doesn’t display this behavior through demonstration.<br>
									o Here there is a hard-coded good-looking outfit matched for ideal price and looks
									(Wizard of Oz as such advanced recommendations we haven’t implemented).
									<li>There is a “similar to this” section at the button for recommendations of similar shoes, this is
									also hard coded and gives an understanding more than provides functionality in the prototype
									as it is not swappable in carrousel style as its design suggests.
									</ul>
									<h4>Prototype Notess</h4>
									<ul>
									<li>All activities in the prototype are hard coded.<br>
									<li>Partial items show that said direction with which they are incomplete is scrollable towards<br>
									<li>A lot of the shop items have yet to be implemented but the original search that can be done in
									the main screen demonstrates this behavior anyway.<br>
								</ul>
